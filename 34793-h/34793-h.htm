<h1><span class="smcap">President's Address.</span></h1>


<p>In the year 1839, with great labor, care, expense, and after
long consultation, was the Rutgers Female Institute founded.
It grew out of an increasing sense of the importance of the
duties of women, and of the need that her work should be
well done. Hence the establishment of the school, with its
course of studies, its libraries, its apparatus, its teachers. A
quarter of a century has witnessed a great change in the education
of woman; and the position of Rutgers Institute
to-day, as a College, marks the character and degree of that
change.</p>

<p>It has been my custom, to make a personal address to the
members of each graduating class, as they have gone forth
from the quiet of the school to the busy walks of life. My
heart now impels me to follow this usage, but the change
that has taken place in this institution, during the past year,
seems to make appropriate to the present occasion, a few
preliminary statements of my views as to what is the true
position of woman, and what should be her education.</p>

<p>These are questions that deeply agitate the public mind.
They are, in fact, the leading questions of the day; but in
regard to them, I shall not shrink from the utterance of my
opinions. Underlying the question of the education of
woman, is the question of her equality with man; for if
woman be inferior to man, so should be her education.</p>

<p>Some might be disposed to reverse this proposition, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
to say that just in proportion to her inferiority, should her
training be more careful and complete. There might seem
to be some truth in this idea; but a little deeper thinking
will convince us that to try to make up in this way for her
supposed deficiency, would be to attempt an impossibility.
The end could not be reached; the bounds that nature had
appointed could not be passed.</p>

<p>It is also clear that if woman be the equal of man, she
should receive as good an education as man, a proposition
too plain for argument. So is also our third proposition&mdash;which
exhausts this branch of the subject&mdash;that if woman be
superior to man, she should receive a better education than
man: for it is a first principle in morals, that every power
which God gave, He meant should be unfolded to its fullest
extent.</p>

<p>I am fully persuaded that the time is not far distant, when
it will be thought almost incredible that the question of the
inferiority of woman should ever have been seriously debated.
For it is not without higher warrant than that of
human reason, that I would claim for woman an equal place
by the side of man. When in the beginning God created
the heavens, the earth, the sea, and all that in them is, even
as He then made laws for the stars and the seas, so did He
then fix and determine forever the sphere and the destiny of
man and of woman. Driven out of Paradise into the world
on account of sin, neither man nor woman took their place
at once; and in the nature of the case, woman's sphere was
the last of the two to be understood.</p>

<p>The Old Testament contains the germs of the great truths
of all time; but over four thousand years were needed to
prepare the human mind for the coming of Christ; and it
was reserved for Christ fully to declare what place the Creator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
had designed for woman. I am fully persuaded that
upon all great questions touching humanity, the human
mind will at length accept the teachings of Christ as final;
and the question whether or not woman is the equal of man,
I conceive to be authoritatively settled by Him, when he pronounces
marriage such a union as excludes the idea that
there can be essential inferiority in one of the parties. His
ideal of marriage, unknown alike to the classical nations and
to the Hebrews, is incompatible with the inequality of the
sexes. Nor do we find a trace in His life or teachings, or
in those of His Apostles, which tends in the least to countenance
such an idea. The few apparent exceptions to this
statement grow out of Oriental usage, or are explained by
the truth that subordination is consistent with equality.
Not even superficial reasoners should have been misled by
these exceptions, when, generally speaking, there is no distinction
in the moral duties enjoined on each, none in the
warnings and promises addressed to each, none at the cross,
none in the day of judgment.</p>

<p>Equality, though it excludes the idea of inferiority, is
consistent with diversity. There is a difference between
the sexes, that at once raises the question whether there
should not be a difference in their education.</p>

<p>After the most careful thought that I could give to the
subject, I am of the opinion that it should be the same to
a much greater extent than most persons are willing to concede.
Up to a certain point, the education of men is much
the same: beyond that point comes in a special training.
Thus, on leaving college, the young man who is to pursue
law, receives a legal training. But the great fact here to be
noticed is, that up to a certain point, all liberally educated
men are trained much in the same manner. For a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
time, a liberal education seems to take no note of the specific
ends, which finally it may be desirable to aim at. It
contents itself with enlarging and strengthening the mental
powers. It unrolls before the young man the ample page
of knowledge, confident that this is the best preparation for
any path that he may finally choose.</p>

<p>If, then, it is best for the young man that by a liberal education,
his memory should be strengthened, his reasoning
powers disciplined, his judgment matured, his mind enlarged&mdash;why
is it not best for the young woman also?
This is a question for those who differ with us to answer.
It is a question that none would seriously ask, were it not
that the minds of many are unconsciously swayed by a belief
in the essential inferiority of woman. It can only
arise from this pernicious error, or from some doubt as to
the real advantage of a liberal education;&mdash;an error and a
doubt, both of which should be remanded to the Dark
Ages.</p>

<p>Generally, then, we would say, that there is no reason
why woman should be debarred from any part of the studies
common to all liberally educated men.</p>

<p>I say, common to all liberally educated men. I do not
wish you to infer that I consider the course of instruction
in our colleges for young men in every particular the wisest
and the best. On the contrary, early in my college life I
thought, and the years of maturer life have strengthened
the idea, that in the curriculum of colleges, too little importance
attaches to the science of nature, and to the study
of the human soul,&mdash;not the study of the abstract metaphysics
which the schoolmen bequeathed to us, but of man
as he is,&mdash;and too little importance attaches to the study of
the Hebrew and the Christian Scriptures,&mdash;the fountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
whence the ever-enlarging river of our civilization flows.
Neither did I then think, nor do I now think, that a
familiarity with the classics alone, is either a sufficient, or
altogether the best, preparation for life in our own day&mdash;for a
life in which shall pulsate all the great emotions of our time,&mdash;for
a life in complete sympathy with nature, with man, and
with God.</p>

<p>In the United States, the college course for young men
was modeled after that of the European Universities, which
were founded when the Greek and the Latin were the only
fully developed tongues; when the languages of modern
Europe were in a formative process; when works on science,
philosophy, medicine, jurisprudence, and theology, and all
legal documents, state papers, and treaties, were done in
Latin; when all discussions and correspondence were carried
on in Latin; and when modern science yet waited for the
thoughts of Bacon, the intuitions of Kepler, and the discoveries
of Galileo.</p>

<p>Now, on the other hand, the Italian, French, German,
and other languages, have been brought to a high state of
perfection, and almost every work on art, science, literature,
or philosophy, is composed in the author's vernacular. Yet
our colleges, with unfortunate fidelity, have hitherto adhered
much too closely to the course of study marked out by their
ancient models.</p>

<p>But nothing should gratify the friends of education more
than the changes that are now beginning to take place, not
only in our own institutions of learning, but even in the
English Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. The Novum
Organum of Bacon has triumphed, and is leading us
from the study of a dead Past to the study of living and
eternal truth. The establishment of scientific departments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and schools of mines, in connection with some of our noble
and time-honored colleges and universities, is a virtual acknowledgment
that not the ancient classics, but the modern
classics, should rank first in the studies of youth; not the
classics of the Greeks and Romans, but the classics of Nature.</p>

<p>I would not be misunderstood in this matter. The grand
classics are grand indeed! Greece and Rome were grand;
but their grandeur grew out of high aspirations, tending to
a grand life. They turned neither to the right nor to the
left, they looked not backward, they went right straight on,
and thus became truly great.</p>

<p>We, too, have a greatness, as a nation, to attain: and we
must attain it, if at all, in the same way. We need not
fear that the truth developed by different nations, will or
can be lost. Truth once known can never be hidden. The
results of each generation and century, pass on into the
future, and are interwoven into the woof of our ever-growing
civilization.</p>

<p>The Greek and Roman energy, thought, and character,
permeate the life and soul of modern Europe. The arts,
the sciences, the literature, the civilization, of Greece and
Rome we have to-day. They are out on the air; they are
incorporated in our social and intellectual life; they are not
afar off, they are here to-night&mdash;here in our streets, here
in our homes and in our hearts. They are living, and speak
with living tongues:&mdash;that part of them found in books
alone may truly be called "dead."</p>

<p>In our opinion, a college founded to-day, should conform
its curriculum to the growth of the world, in letters, and
thought, and science, and civilization, and Christianity;&mdash;while
the Greek and Latin languages should be studied only
for specific ends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>If we had the years required for a thorough study of the
classics, and an equal time to give to the natural sciences,
then both might be pursued to advantage. But as we have
not time to pursue to any considerable extent more than
one of these departments, I would give a rudimentary
training in the classics, and devote the best energies of the
young to those studies which have for their objects, life and
its pursuits, man and his destiny, God and His works.</p>

<p>The sphere of woman differs widely from that of man;
but this is neither the time nor the place to unfold our views
upon the question in what way, and to what extent, this fact
should modify the course of study in a college for women;
a question which all must recognize as one of great practical
difficulty, as well as of great practical importance. The
conclusions at which we have arrived on these subjects&mdash;the
results in part of experience, and in part of the cordial
aid of a large number of distinguished educators&mdash;will soon
be laid before the public in the curriculum of the college.</p>

<p>We therefore here content ourselves with repeating, that
generally the studies pursued by women should be those
that are pursued by men; and that they should be pursued
much to the same extent. Surely, there is nothing which the
under-graduate learns in his college course, which he should
not be glad that his wife should know as well as himself.
Surely a liberal education has miserably failed of its aim,
when a man desires in a wife, not an equal, but a toy or a slave.</p>

<p>The idea of woman as a slave is a barbarian idea. The
savage has it to perfection, and because he has it he is a
savage. The savage makes woman do the work of a beast
of burden; the half-civilized Chinese puts on her all the
drudgery of hard work;&mdash;"the wife drags the plough, the
husband sows the grain."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>To the savage, woman is a slave. The half-civilized man
combines with this the idea of woman as a toy. This is an
unchristian idea; unhappily it is too common even with
us; yet, with some other degrading ideas, it is a relic of
heathenism. The whole difference between civilized Europe,
half-civilized Asia, and savage Africa, can be accurately
measured by the idea of woman; the best test of civilization,
in either a nation or an individual.</p>

<p>The question, then, whether our civilization is to advance
or to retrograde&mdash;stand still it cannot&mdash;depends on the
place hereafter to be given to woman. As to this question,
the present seems to be a sort of crisis. The signs point
both ways; on the whole, the prospect is hopeful and cheering:
but we must either go back or go on; we must become
either more Asiatic or more Christian.</p>

<p>The hopeful indications are general in their character, and
embrace all that is cheering in the signs of the times.
Those that forebode evil are more specific in their relations
to women; and, though differing among themselves, they all
point to one common end, viz., the destruction of the family.</p>

<p>The Church, the State, and the Family, are alike ordained
of God. The ordering of the Family pertains to woman;
of the State, to man; of the Church, to the Lord Jesus
Christ. Each of these organizations exists by divine
right, and therefore, within its own sphere, is sovereign.
Yet the preservation and perfection of all, depend on that
of each. In the words of a distinguished Greek scholar:
"Each inculcating the same lesson, although with sanctions
continually ascending; each successively, in the order of its
rank, supplying the defects of the lower; yet each to be regarded
as divinely appointed by the same eternal Source of
all law and rightful authority, in heaven and earth."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>The family is destroyed when its unity is destroyed. Of
various causes tending to this result, we shall speak only of
two particulars in our legislation. According to the law of
Christ, the husband and wife are one person: to this fact,
the old common law in a good degree conformed; but the
tendency of recent statutes is to do away with this idea, by
making the property of the wife distinct from that of the
husband, and giving to her separately its management;&mdash;thus
at once creating a diversity of interests.</p>

<p>We recognize the necessity, in certain cases, of such a
distinction in the control of property: but we deplore this
necessity, we are fearful as to its tendency, and we hope that
the practice may never extend beyond rare and exceptional
cases.</p>

<p>If each of the contracting parties, as they might properly
be called, have large possessions, so that the disposal of
property does not often arise, the evil is less. But with the
great majority of families that compose the body-politic,
the spending of a little of their very little money is a question
of moment, that comes up from day to day, and almost
from hour to hour: and if a garment cannot be bought, or a
meal provided, without raising the question of separate pecuniary
interests between the heads of the family, and that too
in the presence of the children, the unity of the home, its
sacred peace, and its hallowed lessons, are at an end; and it
may be that the strong passions so constantly appealed to,
will rend the family asunder. We have heard of a legacy
of seven hundred dollars to a wife, that led to a divorce.</p>

<p>In accordance with the effect of such legislation, made to
cover exceptional cases, but which is ominous of general
corruption, are those laws of divorce which, in several of
our States, practically tend to make marriage a contract dissoluble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
at the will of the parties; thus encouraging persons
foolishly to rush into it, and madly to break from it. It
is said that in one New England State, one marriage in ten
is thus dissolved! The State thus presumes, for causes
that the Church does not hold to be sufficient, to put
asunder those whom God hath joined together.</p>

<p>Our object is by no means to discuss these subjects, but
merely to glance at them as illustrations of a strong tendency
to innovate without due regard to the sacred oneness
of the family. Even education is an evil, so far as it may
tend to infringe upon this unity; and it is of the highest
value, only as it may tend to secure it. This is the true
ground of the principle which we before laid down, and
which we would extend to every grade of society, from the
highest to the lowest, viz., that the wife should have as
good an education as the husband; and, what is of equal
importance, the mother should have as good an education
as the children.</p>

<p>Whatever breaks in upon the oneness of the family,
brings with it evil for which it cannot furnish any sufficient
compensation, either to woman or to man. The destruction
of the family is the destruction of woman: it is that
of man also.</p>

<p>The destruction of the family is likewise the destruction
of the State. The family is the foundation stone on which
the higher edifice rests; and if this stone be removed out
of its place, or ground to powder, the more imposing fabric
of government falls to ruin. The no-family and no-government
fallacies are the same in principle; and they complete
themselves when they add, no Church, and no God.</p>

<p>The profligacy of our cities, like the poison of the
cholera, infecting the whole of the country; the frenzy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
fashion, bewildering the minds of women; the lust of gold,
gnawing at the hearts of men; these things of themselves
might lead us to fear that the family and the home might
become things of the past; and if so, our civilization would
vanish, "like the baseless fabric of a vision." But we look
for better things: Christ, the Word of God, "by whom
and for whom are all things," laid the foundations of the
family so deep, that they cannot be removed. We may disregard
them, to our destruction, as did Babylon and Rome
of old, but whatsoever He hath decreed, He will finally
bring it to pass.</p>

<p>That ideal of woman which we would fain behold realized,
is His ideal. He ordained that the place of woman should
be by the side of man, as his equal; and this ideal, which
He foreshadowed in the Scriptures from the beginning, He
will accomplish. His religion is a religion of far-continuing
purposes; it is one religion, from the first promise that
the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head, to
the end of the world.</p>

<p>It may be an appropriate close to these somewhat discursive,
yet related, remarks, to show that the idea of woman
in the old Hebrew Scripture, was the germ that Christianity
is ripening to the flower.</p>

<p>One book of the Scripture seems to have been written
to place a Hebrew youth in full possession of all the wisdom
of age. It states that its design is "to give to the young
knowledge and discretion." I speak, of course, of the book
of Proverbs. This is an extended series of practical precepts;
of precepts everywhere marked by that religious sentiment
which ever gives to practical truth its highest value;
of precepts embracing the whole life of man; of precepts
so profound and exhaustive, that the wisdom and the experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
of all subsequent ages and nations have added to
them but little.</p>

<p>From the difficulty of rendering axioms and pithy sayings
into another language, our translation of this book is
somewhat defective. It often misses the point of the saying
which it aims to reproduce. But there can be no mistake
as to the leading ideas in the description before us. The
place that it holds in the book of all human wisdom, is
good evidence that a high place was meant to be given to
woman in the Hebrew Scripture; its opening and its closing
words, moreover, strengthen this impression. The value
of a perfect woman "is far above rubies." "The heart of her
husband doth safely trust in her; he shall have no need of
spoil." Precious gems&mdash;the favorite form of wealth among
the Orientals&mdash;are thus disparaged in comparison with her;
and he that hath a true woman, needs no other riches.</p>

<p>In the very spirit of the first divine word as to woman&mdash;"It
is not good for man to be alone"&mdash;it is here written;
"She shall do him good and not evil all the days of her life."</p>

<p>Again, at the close of the description, it is written,
"Give her of the fruit of her hands"&mdash;that is, deal justly
with her&mdash;yield not to the mean spirit, that thinks that
whatever is conceded to woman, is so much taken from the
birthright of man. The writer goes beyond the proverb
of the French: "A good wife is half the battle;" and,
though the husband is "known in the gates, when he sitteth
among the elders of the land," his prosperity seems
wholly attributed to her. Indeed, he is reduced to such
insignificance, that all he can do is to stand still and praise
her. This he does with hearty good will; saying, as good
husbands always say to good wives&mdash;common excellence in
woman always affecting a man with uncommon surprise&mdash;"Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest
them all."</p>

<p>Young Ladies of the First Graduating Class of Rutgers
Female College.</p>

<p>In this portraiture of a woman of another country and of
a distant age, to which, for various reasons I have called
the attention of the general audience, there are inwrought
characteristics, the excellence of which I would, in this hour
of parting, hold up to you for imitation.</p>

<p>"She worketh willingly:"&mdash;"in her tongue is the law
of kindness:"&mdash;in her heart is the fear of the Lord.</p>

<p>Of the many things that I would gladly impress on your
hearts, as I address you, as my pupils, for the last time, I
can select but few, and perhaps none more appropriate than
the virtues and excellencies which this portrait suggests.</p>

<p>One characteristic of this woman is energy: "She riseth
while it is yet night":&mdash;"She eateth not the bread of
idleness." She exemplifies the spirit of the truly Scriptural
precept: "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with
thy might." Her example, then, is one of habitual industry,
a habit which has much more to do with a truly virtuous
life than is generally supposed. Labor strengthens all the
virtues; idleness weakens them all:&mdash;idleness is the fruitful
source of vice.</p>

<p>In every sphere in which you may be placed, there will be
work to be done;&mdash;to be done religiously&mdash;that is, faithfully
as unto God;&mdash;to be accepted by you as His manifest
will, and to be done willingly as unto Him.</p>

<p>One of the chief ends of your education has been, to give
you the trained intellect, that you may quickly and correctly
discern, in each relation and circumstance of life&mdash;from day
to day, and from hour to hour&mdash;what is the work that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
are called upon to do. Another chief aim has been to give
you that disciplined self-command that will enable you&mdash;not
lazily putting it off till a more convenient season&mdash;to do
it at once, and to do it thoroughly and well.</p>

<p>If you have here gained or strengthened the habit of industry,
preserve it to the end. Without labor, there is no
excellence and no happiness. It is the most vulgar of all
vulgar errors, that a lady is a person who does nothing.
Such a person would be good for nothing, and miserable
indeed. Work, however, is of many kinds; work of the
brain, and work of the heart, as well as work of the hands;
and the humblest kind is not the hardest.</p>

<p>It is another vulgar error, that work is degrading. Labor
was imposed on our fallen race, because it was fallen; but
the decree went forth more in pity than in anger. Work
was not imposed upon the angels, for they needed no such
compulsion. Angelic natures work willingly and cheerfully;
and how is the idea that to do nothing is a desirable thing,
reconciled with the sublime words, "My Father worketh
hitherto and I work."</p>

<p>In the description of the woman of old, it is said: "In
her tongue, is the law of kindness;" and this I would most
earnestly entreat you to emulate, believing that few things
would conduce more to your usefulness and happiness. Saint
James tells us that "if any man seemeth to be religious,
and bridleth not his tongue, this man's religion is vain."
Elsewhere in his Epistle, you may learn how difficult a
thing he conceives this to be. It requires a perfect control
of one's self, and a large charity. Of the former, we hope
that you have gained something here; the other, you can
gain somewhat from experience, but in perfection only from
the grace of God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>I would have your conversation governed by the charity
of which the Apostle Paul saith, that it "suffereth long and
is kind; envieth not; vaunteth not itself; is not easily
provoked; thinketh no evil." This kindness of spirit,
this charity, is a high Christian grace; but it might almost
be taught by experience, seeing how little we really know
the motives that sway the human soul, and how often the
severe judgments which we pronounce on our fellow-mortals,
have to be reconsidered with much pain and self humiliation,
when perhaps it is forever too late to right the wrong, and
to recompense the suffering that we have occasioned.</p>

<p>Friendships broken, causeless enmities, opportunities for
doing good and getting good thrown away, too often teach
us&mdash;too late to prevent, to ourselves and to others, much
lasting injury&mdash;the value of the law of kindness as the law
of our words. Especially is this law of kindness needed in
the speech of woman, whose hasty, thoughtless words can influence
to fury the pride and wrath of man, and set on fire
his heart with the fires of hell. Dissensions in families,
hatred between neighbors, enmity between states and nations,
follow when woman's tongue embitters man's jealousy
and passion.</p>

<p>If the sphere of woman is hereafter to be enlarged, we all
should more earnestly hope, and more fervently pray, that
she may everywhere carry with her "the ornament of a meek
and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great
price."</p>

<p>What is the characteristic in woman that should most
fasten the affections, and secure the esteem, of man? Is it
the varying charm of manner, or beauty of person? The
Scripture before us, answers these questions in a few decisive
words: "Favor is deceitful,"&mdash;that is, an unsatisfying thing&mdash;"and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
beauty is vain; but a woman that feareth the Lord,
she shall be praised."</p>

<p>I know few things, even in the Scripture, so thoroughly
justified by observation, and at the same time so little
known and regarded, as this. In the Hebrew Scriptures, the
fear of God answers to the love of God in the Christian
Scriptures, and so may be taken as equivalent to true piety:
and true piety in woman is that alone which really can draw
from out the heart of man, the sentiment of lasting veneration.</p>

<p>I cannot urge this as a motive for cultivating the spirit of
piety; but I surely should not conceal from you what this
Scripture so clearly reveals, in this: "Godliness hath the
promise of the life that now is, as well as of that which is to
come." But I would here enforce upon you the duty of
piety, from other considerations. Piety is not only the
highest of duties, but the greatest of privileges.</p>

<p>Young Ladies, life is so limited, our responsibilities are
so great, the consequences of pursuing a wrong course are
so terrible and destructive,&mdash;even so far as this life goes,&mdash;that
you cannot afford to make a mistake at the outset.
Experience is not always a sure guide&mdash;it cannot teach all
the important truths that concern this life; nor can you trust
implicitly to the wisdom of either parent or teacher, nor
commit yourselves to the guidance of passion, or to the
customs and opinions of the world. To what, then, should
you go, to-night, to-morrow, and every day of your lives,
for safe guidance&mdash;for true wisdom? Need I say, to the
Bible alone?&mdash;to the Bible as opened to your minds, and
brought home to your hearts, by the Holy Spirit granted
to you in answer to prayer. By thus listening to its voice,
you listen to the voice of God; by taking hold on its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
truths, you take hold upon eternity. You are thus lifted
above yourselves;&mdash;above your passions, your littleness,
your ambition;&mdash;above the world. You are thus brought
into communion with the Father of your spirits;&mdash;with
God, who alone is sufficient to fill all the aspirations of
the soul. He alone is wise enough to be your sufficient
counsellor;&mdash;He alone is strong enough to give mortals
strength.</p>

<p>Of His glory and His beauty, all the glory and the beauty
of the things that He has made, are but faint emblems and
reflected lights. He alone is worthy to be loved "with all
your heart, and mind, and soul, and strength."</p>

<p>"Remember," then, "your Creator in the days of your
youth." "The fashion of this world passeth away:"&mdash;"lay
up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth
nor rust doth corrupt." "Set your affections on things
above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God": "and
the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God
your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless
unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."</p>
